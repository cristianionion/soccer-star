# Soccer Star
## Cristian Ion

Soccer Star is a 2D game written in rust using Bevy. The user gets to take a penalty shot at a soccer goal. The user gets to select the shot's direction and power by pressing buttons on the keyboard. These actions will decide the x-axis, and y-axis destination of the shot. The challenges of this game are to select the right actions from a rapidly moving arrow and power bar. Based on the shot the game will display a message of the outcome. Outcomes are Goal, and misses by Hitting the post, missing wide, missing short, and missing high.
