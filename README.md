# Soccer Star
## Cristian Ion

Soccer Star will be a game written in rust where the user gets to play as a field player taking a penalty shot against a goal keeper. The user can control their shot by pressing a key while an arrow quickly moves left and right, then up and down, and then finally shrinking and growing. These actions will decide to which side, how high, and with how much power the ball is shot towards the goal. The challenge will be in taking actions from a rapidly changing arrow that will result in a shot that does not get saved by the goal keeper, hit the crossbar or posts, or miss the goal entirely.
